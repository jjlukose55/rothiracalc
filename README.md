# rothiracalc
A paramaterized excel project that estimates an account's balance throughout it's life. Built to be a predictor for Roth IRA growth.

This project was mostly completed as a means of estimating the value of a personal retirement account. It takes in the below parameters
to calculate the month by month value of the account, and then generates a financial prospectus using the calculated data. This model
expects to generate a tax-free account like a Roth IRA, and this is important to understand because this model does not account for the taxes
involved in a tax-deferred account.
